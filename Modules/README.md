# Modules
It is encouraged (well, actually recommended) that these programs are used as Modules rather than Standalone scripts, even though they have the capability.
## How would I use it as a module?
You simply use it as with any module. Import it as such:
```python
import spoof
```
and call the class:
```python
class = spoof.Email()
```
before setting your program to operate as you wish.
This format will remain consistent within all modules.
## How do I suggest a module?
Send an email to odinsecurity@protonmail.com and write "EWAT Feature" in the subject line.
Alternate methods will be available soon.
